# Go Wild Quiz 🐾

This project was created during the JavaScript/React module. It's an interactive quiz game that fetches real-time questions from the Open Trivia DB API, specifically focused on animals.

The goal was to apply core JavaScript skills — working with APIs, DOM manipulation, and interactive UI elements — while building a user-friendly, responsive game from scratch.
